# ImpossibleEEBO3

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the cryptographic analysis and decryption of a cipher believed to be encrypted using an unknown method, possibly involving a 4-dimensional magic hypercube. A key is thought to play a crucial role in the encryption/decryption process. Our goal is to explore various decryption methods and analyze the cipher's structure to uncover its hidden message.

## Recent Progress

1. **Separation of Key and Cipher**:
   - Created separate files for the key (`key.txt`) and the cipher (`cipher.txt`).
   - Updated the `hypercube_cipher_analysis.py` script to read both files independently.

2. **Dedicated Magic Hypercube Decryption Implementation**:
   - Maintained the `magic_hypercube_decryption.py` file for magic hypercube-based decryption.
   - Continued use of the `MagicHypercubeDecryption` class with static methods for decryption.

3. **Enhanced Mapping and Decryption Strategies**:
   - Kept the `map_cipher_to_vertices` method to associate cipher text characters with hypercube vertices.
   - Maintained the `decrypt_with_magic_hypercube` method with multiple mapping strategies.

4. **Improved Analysis**:
   - Updated the `hypercube_cipher_analysis.py` script to analyze both the key and cipher separately.
   - Enhanced the relationship analysis between the cipher, key, and magic hypercube properties.

## Current Focus

- Analyzing the relationships between the key, cipher, and magic hypercube characteristics.
- Fine-tuning the decryption algorithm based on observed patterns and the separate key file.
- Exploring how the key interacts with the magic hypercube properties in the encryption/decryption process.

## Next Steps

1. Refine the analysis to take into account the separate key file.
2. Implement and test all mapping strategies with the new file structure.
3. Analyze decryption results for patterns or partially decrypted segments.
4. Consider implementing additional custom mapping strategies based on observed cipher and key characteristics.
5. Explore hybrid approaches combining the magic hypercube method with other cryptographic techniques.
6. Investigate the possibility of reverse-engineering the encryption process based on decryption attempts and the known key.
7. Develop a method to evaluate and score decryption results for automated analysis.

This project continues to evolve as we delve deeper into the intricacies of the cipher and its relationship with the key and the magic hypercube. Each iteration provides new insights into the structure and possible encryption methods used, guiding our ongoing research and development efforts.
