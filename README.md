# ImpossibleEEBO3

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the cryptographic analysis and decryption of a cipher believed to be encrypted using an unknown method, possibly involving a 4-dimensional magic hypercube. The key "TheGiant" is thought to play a crucial role in the encryption/decryption process. Our goal is to explore various decryption methods and analyze the cipher's structure to uncover its hidden message.

## Background

The cipher and its associated riddle are connected to the KN-44 weapon from the game Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. This connection provides additional context and potentially useful numerical relationships:

- The number 44 from KN-44 may have significance in the encryption or decryption process.
- The key "TheGiant" consists of 8 characters, which could be divided into two groups of 4, possibly relating to the 4D nature of the hypercube or the game's context.

These connections to Black Ops 3 and the KN-44 weapon may provide valuable insights into the cipher's structure and solution method.

## Recent Progress

1. **Cipher Structure Analysis**:
   - Confirmed the cipher text consists of 4 lines with a total of 192 characters.
   - Updated the `hypercube_cipher_analysis.py` script to correctly analyze the multi-line structure of the cipher.

2. **Magic Hypercube Characteristics**:
   - Identified key properties of the 4D magic hypercube, including vertex count, edge count, and magic constant.

3. **Enhanced Cipher Analysis**:
   - Conducted detailed analysis of cipher characteristics, including unique character count and character distribution across lines.
   - Performed factor analysis on cipher length and explored relationships with hypercube properties.

4. **Decryption Attempts**:
   - Continued refining decryption strategies based on the new insights from the cipher and hypercube analysis.

## Key Findings

- Magic Hypercube Characteristics:
  - Vertex Count: 256
  - Edge Count: 1024
  - Magic Constant: 130
  - Dimension: 4
  - Size per Dimension: 4

- Cipher Characteristics:
  - Total Length: 192 characters
  - Number of Lines: 4
  - Unique Characters: 62
  - Key: "TheGiant" (8 characters long)
  - Characters per Line: [55, 53, 50, 34]
  - Most Common Character: '1' (frequency: 9)

- Relationships and Observations:
  - The cipher length (192) is exactly 3/4 of the hypercube vertex count (256).
  - The number of cipher lines (4) matches the number of hypercube dimensions (4).
  - The key length (8) is twice the hypercube size per dimension (4).
  - The difference between the magic constant (130) and unique characters (62) is 68, which is half of 136 (the difference between cipher length and vertex count).
  - The edge count (1024) divided by cipher length (192) is approximately 5.33, close to 16/3 (where 16 is 4^2, relating to the 4D nature).
  - The difference between the longest and shortest cipher lines (21) is 1/6 of the difference between vertex count and magic constant (126).
  - The cipher length has factors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 192]

## Current Focus

- Analyzing the significance of the numerical relationships discovered between cipher characteristics and hypercube properties.
- Exploring potential mappings between the 192 cipher characters and the 256 vertices of the hypercube, considering the 3/4 ratio.
- Investigating how the key "TheGiant" might interact with the hypercube properties for encryption/decryption, particularly its length being twice the hypercube dimension size.
- Examining the role of the magic constant (130) in potential encryption/decryption processes.
- Exploring the significance of the number 44 (from KN-44) in the cipher structure or decryption process.
- Investigating how splitting the key "TheGiant" into two groups of 4 characters might relate to the 4D hypercube or decryption method.

## Next Steps

1. Develop a visualization tool to map the cipher characters onto the hypercube, considering the uneven line lengths and the 3/4 vertex usage.
2. Analyze the distribution of the 62 unique characters across the four lines, looking for patterns that might relate to the hypercube's 4D structure.
3. Investigate how the factors of 192 might relate to potential subdivision or traversal patterns within the hypercube structure.
4. Explore encryption/decryption methods that utilize the magic constant (130) in conjunction with the observed numerical relationships.
5. Implement new decryption strategies that leverage the relationship between key length (8) and hypercube dimensions (4x4x4x4).
6. Develop algorithms to test various mappings of the 192 characters onto the 256 vertices, focusing on methods that could explain the uneven line lengths.
7. Investigate potential significance of the edge count (1024) in the encryption process, particularly its relationship to the cipher length.
8. Explore how the number 44 might be incorporated into the decryption process, possibly as a key component or a modulus in mathematical operations.
9. Experiment with splitting the key "TheGiant" into "The" and "Giant" (or other 4-character groupings) and using these subgroups in different ways within the decryption algorithm.
10. Research the KN-44 weapon from Black Ops 3 for any additional numerical or structural clues that might relate to the cipher or hypercube properties.

This project continues to evolve as we uncover new insights into the structure of the cipher and its relationship with the magic hypercube. Each analysis brings us closer to understanding the underlying encryption method and ultimately deciphering the hidden message.
