# ImpossibleEEBO3

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the cryptographic analysis and decryption of a cipher believed to be encrypted using an unknown method, possibly involving a 4-dimensional magic hypercube. The key "TheGiant" is thought to play a crucial role in the encryption/decryption process. Our goal is to explore various decryption methods and analyze the cipher's structure to uncover its hidden message.

## Recent Progress

1. **Cipher Structure Analysis**:
   - Confirmed the cipher text consists of 4 lines with a total of 192 characters.
   - Updated the `hypercube_cipher_analysis.py` script to correctly analyze the multi-line structure of the cipher.

2. **Magic Hypercube Characteristics**:
   - Identified key properties of the 4D magic hypercube, including vertex count, edge count, and magic constant.

3. **Enhanced Cipher Analysis**:
   - Conducted detailed analysis of cipher characteristics, including unique character count and character distribution across lines.
   - Performed factor analysis on cipher length and explored relationships with hypercube properties.

4. **Decryption Attempts**:
   - Continued refining decryption strategies based on the new insights from the cipher and hypercube analysis.

## Key Findings

- Magic Hypercube Characteristics:
  - Vertex Count: 256
  - Edge Count: 1024
  - Magic Constant: 130
  - Dimension: 4
  - Size per Dimension: 4

- Cipher Characteristics:
  - Total Length: 192 characters
  - Number of Lines: 4
  - Unique Characters: 62
  - Key: "TheGiant" (8 characters long)
  - Characters per Line: [55, 53, 50, 34]
  - Most Common Character: '1' (frequency: 9)

- Relationships and Observations:
  - The cipher length (192) is exactly 3/4 of the hypercube vertex count (256).
  - No obvious alignments found between cipher length and hypercube characteristics.
  - The cipher length has factors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 192]

## Current Focus

- Analyzing the significance of the uneven distribution of characters across the four lines of the cipher.
- Exploring potential mappings between the 192 cipher characters and the 256 vertices of the hypercube.
- Investigating how the key "TheGiant" might interact with the hypercube properties for encryption/decryption.

## Next Steps

1. Develop a visualization tool to map the cipher characters onto the hypercube, considering the uneven line lengths.
2. Analyze the distribution of the 62 unique characters across the four lines for any patterns or significance.
3. Investigate potential relationships between the factors of 192 and the hypercube structure.
4. Explore how the magic constant (130) might be utilized in the encryption/decryption process.
5. Implement new decryption strategies that take into account the specific character distribution across lines.
6. Analyze the relationship between the key length (8) and the hypercube dimensions (4x4x4x4).
7. Develop algorithms to test various mappings of the 192 characters onto the 256 vertices, considering the 3/4 ratio.

This project continues to evolve as we uncover new insights into the structure of the cipher and its relationship with the magic hypercube. Each analysis brings us closer to understanding the underlying encryption method and ultimately deciphering the hidden message.
