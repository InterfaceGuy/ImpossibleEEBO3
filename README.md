# ImpossibleEEBO3

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the cryptographic analysis and decryption of "TheGiantCipher". The cipher is believed to be encrypted using an unknown method, possibly involving a 4-dimensional magic hypercube. The key "TheGiant" is thought to play a crucial role in the encryption/decryption process. Our goal is to explore various decryption methods and analyze the cipher's structure to uncover its hidden message.

## Recent Progress

1. **Code Refactoring and Modularization**:
   - Separated the hypercube and magic hypercube analysis into independent scripts:
     - `hypercube_analysis.py`: Contains the `Hypercube4D` class
     - `magic_hypercube_analysis.py`: Contains the `MagicHypercube4D` class
   - Created `decrypt_attempts.py` for decryption methods and main execution

2. **Enhanced Magic Hypercube Decryption**:
   - Implemented multiple mapping strategies in the `decrypt_with_magic_hypercube` method:
     - 'default': Original mapping strategy
     - 'reverse': Starts from (3,3,3,3) and moves towards (0,0,0,0)
     - 'descending': Sorts vertices in descending order
     - 'ascending': Sorts vertices in ascending order
     - 'value_ascending': Sorts vertices based on magic values in ascending order
     - 'value_descending': Sorts vertices based on magic values in descending order
   - Incorporated both vertex coordinates and magic values in the decryption shift calculation

3. **Improved Integration**:
   - Updated `decrypt_attempts.py` to use the actual `MagicHypercube4D` class instead of a dummy implementation

## Current Focus

- Analyzing results from different mapping strategies in the magic hypercube decryption
- Fine-tuning the decryption algorithm based on observed patterns
- Exploring the relationship between "TheGiant" key and the magic hypercube properties

## Next Steps

1. Implement dynamic magic hypercube generation for each decryption operation
2. Develop hybrid approaches combining the magic hypercube method with established cryptographic algorithms
3. Investigate adaptive key derivation methods to strengthen key usage
4. Explore multi-layer decryption approaches combining multiple techniques
5. Consider quantum-resistant techniques for future-proofing the encryption method

This project continues to evolve as we explore various cryptographic techniques and their potential applications to "TheGiantCipher". Each iteration provides new insights into the structure and possible encryption methods used, guiding our ongoing research and development efforts.
